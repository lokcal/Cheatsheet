# Manual installation
The recommended way of adding fonts that are not in the repositories of your system is described in #Creating a package. This gives pacman the ability to remove or update them at a later time.

Alternatively, fonts can be installed manually:

- For a single user, install fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts/.
    - In many cases this suffices, unless you run graphical applications as other users.
    - In the past ~/.fonts/ was used, but is now deprecated.
- For system-wide (all users) installation, place your fonts under /usr/local/share/fonts/.
    - You may need to create the directory first; mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts.
    - /usr/share/fonts/ is under the purview of the package manager, and should not be modified manually.
The creation of a subdirectory structure is up to the user, and varies among Linux distributions.
For clarity, it is good to keep each font in its own directory. Fontconfig will search its default paths recursively, ensuring nested files get picked up.
