# nice
# Execute a program with a custom scheduling priority (niceness).
# Niceness values range from -20 (the highest priority) to 19 (the lowest).
# More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/nice>.

# Launch a program with altered priority:
nice -n niceness_value command

# How To Set Default Nice Value Of a Specific User’s Processes
ou can set the default nice value of a particular user or group in the /etc/security/limits.conf file. 
Its primary function is to define the resource limits for the users logged in via PAM.

# The syntax for defining a limit for a user is as follows (and the possible values of the various columns are explained in the file)
## #<domain>   <type>  <item>  <value>

# Now use the syntax below where hard – means enforcing hard links and soft means – enforcing the soft limits.
<username>  <hard|soft>  priority  <nice value>

# Alternativ, create a file /etc/security/limits.d/tecmint-priority.conf for user tecmint:
tecmint  hard  priority  10
##Save and close the file. From now on, any process owned by tecmint will have a nice value of 10 and PR of 30.
