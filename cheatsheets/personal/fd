explanation: An alternative to `find`. Aims to be faster and easier to use than `find`.

# Recursively find files matching the given pattern in the current directory:
fd pattern

# Find files that begin with "foo":
fd '^foo'

# Find files with a specific extension:
fd --extension txt

# Find files in a specific directory:
fd pattern path/to/directory

# Searching for a particular file name:
fd -g <file name>.<file extension>

# Include ignored and hidden files in the search:
fd --hidden --no-ignore pattern

# Excluding specific files or directories:
fd -E <file or directories which should be excluded> <search query>
