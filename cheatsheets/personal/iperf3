# iperf3
# Traffic generator for testing network bandwidth.
# More information: <https://iperf.fr>.

# Run iperf3 as a server:
iperf3 -s

# Run an iperf3 server on a specific port:
iperf3 -s -p port

# Start bandwidth test:
iperf3 -c server

# specify the format with -f (k, m, g for Kbits, Mbits, Gbits or K, M, G for KBytes, Mbytes, Gbytes)
iperf3 -s -f K

# Run iperf3 in multiple parallel streams:
iperf3 -c server -P streams

# You can set the window size/socket buffer size using the -w flag as shown.
iperf3 -c 192.168.10.1 -f K -w 500K

# Reverse direction of the test. Server sends data to the client:
iperf3 -c server -R

# run iperf3 in client mode using -c flag and specify the host on which the server is running (either using its IP address or domain or hostname).
iperf3 -c 192.168.10.1 -f K

# you can run the server as a daemon, using the -D flag and write server messages to a log file, as follows.
$ iperf3 -s -D > iperf3log
