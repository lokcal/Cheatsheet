# Adding mount and premission
vim /etc/export

# UPDATE EXPORTS
# After editing /etc/exports
exportfs -arv

# To view the current loaded exports state in more detail
exportfs -v

# LIST EXPORTS
# showmount -e
Export list for myserver:
/export/home       10.1.0.0/24

# SHOW CLIENTS
showmount 

# Restricting NFS to interfaces/IPs
/etc/nfs.conf
[nfsd]
host=192.168.1.123
 # Alternatively, use the hostname.
 # host=myhostname

### Client

# For NFSv3 use this command to show the server's exported file systems:
showmount -e servername

# For NFSv4 mount the root NFS directory and look around for available mounts:
mount server:/ /mountpoint/on/client

# Then mount omitting the server's NFS export root:
mount -t nfs -o vers=4 servername:/music /mountpoint/on/client

# If mount fails try including the server's export root (required for Debian/RHEL/SLES, some distributions need -t nfs4 instead of -t nfs):
mount -t nfs -o vers=4 servername:/srv/nfs/music /mountpoint/on/client

### Tips and tricks
## Performance tuning

# When using NFS on a network with a significant number of clients one may increase the default NFS threads from 8 to 16 or even a higher,
# depending on the server/network requirements:
/etc/nfs.conf
[nfsd]
threads=16
