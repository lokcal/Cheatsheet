#Headings
Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:

# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

# Paragraphs
Body copy written as normal plain-text will be wrapped with <p></p> tags in the rendered HTML.

So this:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel,

# Breaks
\n

#Horizontal Rule
The HTML <hr> element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can use of the following for this purpose:

___: three consecutive underscores
---: three consecutive dashes
***: three consecutive asterisks

#Emphasis
##Bold
**rendered as bold text**
##Italics
_rendered as italicized text_

# formatting
*em* _em_
**strong** __strong__
~~strikethrough~~

# Blockquotes
> first level and paragraph
>> second level and first paragraph
>
> first level and second paragraph

# lists
## unordered - use *, +, or -
        * Red
        * Green
          - Yellow
        * Blue

## ordered
        1. First
        2. Second
        3. Third

# Todo List
- [ ] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- [ ] Consectetur adipiscing elit
- [ ] Integer molestie lorem at massa
## Links in todo lists
- [ ] [foo](#bar)
- [ ] [baz](#qux)
- [ ] [fez](#faz)

# Footnotes
This is some text[^1] with a footnote reference link.

The accompanying text for the footnote can be added elsewhere in the document using the following syntax:
[^1]: "This is a footnote"
##Inline footnotes
Some markdown parsers like Remarkable also support inline footnotes.
Inline footnotes are written using the following syntax: [^2 "This is an inline footnote"].

#Code
Wrap inline snippets of code with a single backtick: `.

# Folds
<details>
 <summary>Summary Goes Here</summary>
 ...this is hidden, collapsable content...
</details>

## "Fenced" code block
```html
Example text here...
```
##Indented code
You may also indent several lines of code by at least four spaces, but this is not recommended as it is harder to read,
harder to maintain, and doesn't support syntax highlighting
  // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

# Links
##Autolinks
<http://foo.bar.baz>
##Inline links
[Assemble](http://assemble.io)
##Link titles
[Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/ "Visit Assemble!")
##Named Anchors
Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page.

# Html syntax Center
<center>Centered text</center>

# Html Syntax color text
<span style="color:blue">some *This is Blue italic.* text</span>

#YouTube Videos
They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
