explanation: rg - recursively search the current directory for lines matching a pattern

# Recursively search the current directory for a regex pattern:
rg pattern

# Search for pattern including all .gitignored and hidden files:
rg -uu pattern

# List matching files, including a count
rg -c NEEDLE

# Search case-insensitively
rg -i NEEDLE

# Search exatly for foo (pattern)
rg "foo\b"

# Search for a pattern only in a certain filetype (e.g., html, css, etc.):
rg -t filetype pattern

# Donâ€™t search in file type config
rg -Tconfig

# Search for a pattern only in a subset of directories:
rg pattern set_of_subdirs

# Search for a pattern in files matching a glob (e.g., `README.*`):
rg pattern -g glob

# Search for multiple patterns
rg -e NEEDLE1 -e NEEDLE2

# Only list matched files (useful when piping to other commands):
rg --files-with-matches pattern

# Show lines that do not match the given pattern:
rg --invert-match pattern

# Search a literal string pattern:
rg -F string

# Displays built-in available types and their corresponding globs
rg --type-list

# Replace
rg fast README.md -r FAST

# Replace the whole matching line
rg fast README.md -or FAST

# Search inside of gzip
rg -a -z string
