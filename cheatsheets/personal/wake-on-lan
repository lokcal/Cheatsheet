# check if Intraface has Wake-on-LAN on
ethtool interface | grep Wake-on


# Enable wol
# The Wake-on values define what activity triggers wake up: d (disabled), p (PHY activity), u (unicast activity), m (multicast activity), b (broadcast activity), 
# a (ARP activity), and g (magic packet activity). The value g is required for WoL to work, if not, the following command enables the WoL feature in the driver:
ethtool -s interface wol g

# Make wol persistance (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wake-on-LAN)
# If using netctl, one can make this setting persistent by adding the following the netctl profile:
##/etc/netctl/profile
ExecUpPost='/usr/bin/ethtool -s interface wol g'
