CODE   MEANING       DESCRIPTION

# Informational Requests: 1XX
100    Continue      The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.
101    Switching     Protocols	The requester has asked the server to change protocols using a protocol upgrade mechanism, and the server has agreed.
102    Processing    The server has accepted the entire request but is still processing it.
103    Early Hints   Use it with the Link header to preload resources while the server prepares a response.

# Success Requests: 2XX

200     OK                 The request succeeded.
201     Created            The server acknowledged a newly created resource.
202     Accepted           The server has received the client’s request but is still processing it.
203     Non-Authoritative  The server’s response to the client differs from the initial response that the server sent.
        Information
204     No Content         The server has processed the request but isn’t returning any content.
205     Reset Content      The client should refresh the document sample.
206     Partial Content    The server is sending only part of the resource.
207     Multi-Status       The server response may contain multiple response codes.
208     Already Reported   The server response highlights duplicate internal contents with this status code.
226     IM Used            IM stands for “instance manipulation” in HTTP Delta Coding. The server has fulfilled a GET request, and the server response involves IMs.

# Redirection Requests: 3XX
300     Multiple Choices   The client must choose among several possible responses for the server request.
301     Moved Permanently  The server tells the client the requested resource is now at another URI permanently.
302     Found              The server tells the client that the requested resource is temporarily at another URI.
303     See Other          The server doesn’t redirect the client to the requested resource but to another page.
304     Not Modified       The server response is the same as in the past, so the client can continue to use the client’s cached version of the server response.
305     Use Proxy (deprecated) The client could only access the requested resource through a proxy given in the response. Deprecation was because in-band configuration of a proxy is insecure.
306     (unused/reserved)   A previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification used this response code.
307     Temporary Redirect  The server tells the client that the resource they are looking for is temporarily at another URI.
                            Unlike 302, the client must access the new URI using the same HTTP method as the original URI.
308     Permanent Redirect  The server tells the client that the resource they are looking for is now at another URI permanently.
                            Unlike 301, the client must access the new URI using the same HTTP method as the original URI.

# Client Errors: 4XX

410	Gone	The resource sought by the client is permanently unavailable.

425	Too Early	The server aborted a request that might be part of an (intentional or unintentional) replay attack.
426	Upgrade Required	The server would only perform the request after the client upgrades to one or more different protocols specified in its Upgrade header in a 426 response.
428	Precondition Required	The origin server requires the request to satisfy certain conditions.
429	Too Many Requests	The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.
431	Request Header Fields Too Large	The server is unwilling to process the request because of oversized header fields.
