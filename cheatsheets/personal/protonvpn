All connect options can be used with the -p flag to explicitly specify which transmission protocol is used for that connection (either udp or tcp).

####
To enable Kill Switch, open the configuration menu with protonvpn configure, then select 5 for Kill Switch and confirm the activation with either 1 or 2, depending on your preference.

1 will block access from your directly connected network (e.g. public WiFi) and is recommended for laptops that may connect to untrusted networks.

2 will allow access from your directly connected network and is for computers that donâ€™t leave a secure and trusted LAN, like your home network.

On the next connection Kill Switch will be enabled.
