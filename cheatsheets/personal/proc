# Display some useful memory statistics, often used by programs like htop(1).
cat /proc/meminfo

# See the command line arguments that started the process
cat /proc/<pid>/cmdline

# See the process's environment variables

###
Within /proc’s numbered directories you will find a few files and links. Remember that these directories’ numbers correlate to the PID of the command being run within them. Let’s use an example. On my system, there is a folder name /proc/12:
# cat /proc/12/status

Name:	xenwatch
State:	S (sleeping)
Tgid:	12
Pid:	12
PPid:	2
TracerPid:	0
Uid:	0	0	0	0
Gid:	0	0	0	0
FDSize:	64
Groups:
Threads:	1
SigQ:	1/4592
SigPnd:	0000000000000000
ShdPnd:	0000000000000000
SigBlk:	0000000000000000
SigIgn:	ffffffffffffffff
SigCgt:	0000000000000000
CapInh:	0000000000000000
CapPrm:	ffffffffffffffff
CapEff:	ffffffffffffffff
CapBnd:	ffffffffffffffff
Cpus_allowed:	1
Cpus_allowed_list:	0
Mems_allowed:	00000000,00000001
Mems_allowed_list:	0
voluntary_ctxt_switches:	84
nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:	0


So, what does this mean? Well, the important part is at the top. We can see from the status file that this process belongs to xenwatch. Its current state is sleeping, and its process ID is 12, obviously. We also can see who is running this, as UID and GID are 0, indicating that this process belongs to the root user.

In any numbered directory, you will have a similar file structure. The most important ones, and their descriptions, are as follows:

- cmdline – command line of the process
- environ – environmental variables
- fd – file descriptors
- limits – contains information about the limits of the process
- mounts – related information

You will also notice a number of links in the numbered directory:

- cwd – a link to the current working directory of the process
- exe – link to the executable of the process
- root – link to the work directory of the process

This should get you started with familiarizing yourself with the /proc directory. It should also provide insight to how a number of commands obtain their info, such as uptime, lsof, mount, and ps, just to name a few.
